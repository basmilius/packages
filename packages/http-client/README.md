# `@basmilius/http-client`

This repository contains the source code for the Http client that I use in personal Vue projects. It requires you to create dto's for objects and services for api calls.

## ⭐️ Prerequisites

- Bun >= 1.2.11
- Node >= 23

## 🚀 Getting started

1. Run `bun install` in the root of the project.
2. Run `bun --cwd packages/http-client build` to build the project.
